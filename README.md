# Note Taker Application - John Zigterman

## Description

- I created an express.js backend for this note taking application.
- I set up a comprehensive file structure and set of paths for api requests.
- These allow the user to add a note that will be saved in a db.json file as part of a stringified array.
- This project uses express, uuid, and a custom version of clog.
- The user interface is a web page that can be accessed in a browser.

## Installation

This application can be accessed in a browser by either locally hosting it on one's own computer or accessing it through a hosting service like heroku.

## Usage

The user simply enters text into the provided fields and saves their note when they feel it is finished. The note can be called back up by clicking on its name in the left hand bar, and deleted by clicking the red trash can icon next to the note.

## Credits

I, John Paul Zigterman, completed this project by myself with the aid of the resources provided to me by the MSU coding bootcamp.
